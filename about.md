### Someone Changed Her Mind: a book by Fran Gale

A daughter is convinced to leave her loving family and past. Her mother searches for answers.

When a mother discovers her daughter's car abandoned in the driveway, a struggle is triggered between the mother and a shadow community determined to separate the daughter from her family. Mother and daughter embark on separate, but parallel, journeys of uncertainty, mystery, pain, and mistrust. Readers will follow the mother's struggle to reach her daughter, while finding few answers from the legal, mental health, and faith communities.

As accusations abound and perpetrators are insinuated, one wonders, in the end, who are the real victims?
