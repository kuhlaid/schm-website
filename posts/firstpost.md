WOW!!! I am loving this Lume static site generator [https://lume.land/](https://lume.land/). As a Windows OS user, my first experience with Lume was magical.

## Why I love you so

I have anxiously awaited a stable release of Deno for some time. I cringe at the bloated nature of NodeJs projects with their `node_modules` directory that becomes a black hole of storage consumption for developers. However when I installed the [blog example from Lume](https://github.com/lumeland/base-blog), it runs on my localhost with only ~15Mb of storage (including compiled site content) and contains 107 files! 107 files!

I stumbled upon Lume while I was in the middle of installing a Docusaurus site, and gave up on Docusaurus after waiting for 10 minutes for the node_modules to install! When I bailed on the Docusaurus install, the node_modules directory contained well over 10k files, with >200Mb in storage being consumed. That is a huge difference between Lume and Docusaurus. I was forced to pause my cloud syncing app because the computer was allocating more resources uploading the files from the node_modules directory than installing Docusaurus. I love Docusaurus as well but it is bloated due to NodeJs.

In short, Lume is the new love of my life in the world of static site generators.
